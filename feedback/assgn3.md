-2 since (at least on my computer & browser) when I created a new widget on a list that was longer than my browser's window,
it wouldn't let me scroll down enough to see the new widget. Your code created it, but I couldn't actually scroll to view it. If this isn't the case on your computer, I'll restore your points.
