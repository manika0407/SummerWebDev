Hey,

The links on your left pane on https://cs5610-webdev-22.herokuapp.com/assignment2/website/website-new.html link to pages list, instead of webstie list.
Also the cogs should link to edit. Everything on https://cs5610-webdev-22.herokuapp.com/assignment2/website/website-list.html works fine, just make sure to get the
same behaviour in your left pane on the edit & new pages.

Also for your new widget pages were not supposed to have the delete button, e.g. https://cs5610-webdev-22.herokuapp.com/assignment2/widget/widget-chooser.html# and click header.

score: 87/88
